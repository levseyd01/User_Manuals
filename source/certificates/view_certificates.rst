.. note::

   Restricted securities are securities acquired in unregistered, private sales from the issuer or from an affiliate of the issuer.
   Investors typically receive restricted securities through:

   - private placement offerings,
   - Regulation D offerings,
   - employee stock benefit plans, as compensation for professional services, or
   - in exchange for providing "seed money" or start-up capital to the company. Rule 144(a)(3) identifies what sales produce restricted securities.

.. note::

   If you acquire restricted securities, you almost always will receive a certificate stamped with a "restricted" legend.
